## Introduction

This is my first blog post focused on hardware. While working on my website, I realized that some of my most interesting projects were physical systems that deserved proper explanation.

That realization pushed me to document my reseeding drone project.

## What I Built

I designed a **450 mm autonomous reseeding drone** using a Pixhawk flight controller and GPS-based navigation.

The project includes:
- A 450 mm quadcopter frame
- GPS-guided autonomous flight
- Pixhawk-based flight control
- A concept payload system for seed dispersal

The goal of the drone is environmental restoration, specifically reaching areas where manual reseeding would be slow, unsafe, or inefficient.

## Conclusion

Building the blog inspired me to treat this drone as more than a prototype. Writing about it helped clarify its purpose, technical scope, and future improvements, turning it into a documented engineering project rather than just a build.
