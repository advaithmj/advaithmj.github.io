## Introduction

This is my first blog post. I wanted to document how building my website pushed me to take one of my projects more seriously.

While setting up my blog, I realized I needed a real project to write about, not just experiments or small demos.

## What I Built

I built **SafePulse**, a mobile application focused on safety, health monitoring, and trusted communication.

The project includes:
- A multi-screen mobile interface
- Secure user authentication
- Real-time alerts and notifications
- Structured backend logic instead of quick hacks

Working on the website made it clear that if I wanted my work to be understandable to others, the project itself needed to be well organized and documented.

## Conclusion

Creating this blog directly inspired me to clean up, document, and publish the SafePulse project. Writing about my work forced me to think more carefully about design decisions and long-term goals instead of just making things work.
